                                    Lightning started out as an arrogant, selfish, and conceited racecar who felt he did not need any help to win races.<br>
                                    He was unsatisfied with having the small and unglamorous Rust-eze as a sponsor, intended to ditch them for Dinoco the first chance he got.<br>
                                    When asked about his tie-breaker race and who he wanted to give his free tickets to, it dawned on him that he did not have any friends.<br>
                                    After winding up in Radiator Springs by accident, he starts to lose his less desirable traits as he forms a bond with the town and its residents.<br>
                                    He was very touched when Mater saw him as his best friend and grateful to Sally for offering him a place to stay at her motel.

                                    His racing number, "95", is a reference to the year 1995, when Pixar's first feature-length film, Toy Story was released. Originally, his number was going to be 57, which references 1957 the year John Lasseter, the director of the first two Cars films, was born.

                                    Lightning's last name "McQueen" is a reference to Glenn McQueen, a supervising animator at Pixar who died in 2002.

                                    Lightning McQueen is unique among other Pixar main characters, as he does both lose and then win; he gave up the Piston Cup to Chick Hicks so he can help The King finish his last race, but the loss was meant as a lesson for him, as he learned from Doc Hudson that there are more important things in life than winning, and his heroic act made him earn applause from his fans. Therefore, despite losing, McQueen is still considered the winner in the eyes of his fans and his new friends from Radiator Springs due to the actions of Chick Hicks.

                                    In the first official teaser trailer of Cars 2, for unknown reasons, Lightning McQueen has on his original Rust-eze customization, which never appeared in the sequel. It may be because the new paint job wasn't finalized at the time of the release of the teaser trailer.

                                    Likewise, in the first teaser trailer for Cars 3, McQueen is sporting the original Rust-eze logo when he crashes, unlike the final film with the same scene. His first paint job in the film likely wasn't finalized either at the time of the trailer's release.
